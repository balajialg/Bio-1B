#### Description
This notebook uses data science tools to analyze data representing beak sizes of Darwin's Finches, Geospiza fortis, for those that survived a drought and those that did not. The distributions are compared using permutation testing and the mean differences between distributions. P-value tests are conducted to determine statistical significance. This is a Jupyter Introduction Notebook to prepare students for the Strawberry Creek Lab.

#### Description
This notebook uses data science tools to analyze, interpret and visualize student collected data from the UC Berkeley campus. Using fundamental data analytics, this notebooks uses biological metrics to determine whether or not there is a statistical significance of the ecological health of two branches of Strawberry Creek.

#### Description
This notebook uses data science tools to simulate predator prey interactions and observe the changes in these interactions under different parameters. Data analysis tools allows for simulation under circumstances that otherwise would not have been feasible in real life. The main purpose of this notebook is to determine how certain parameters affect predator prey interactions.

#### Description
This notebook uses data science tools to simulate natural selection for light and dark mice in light and dark environments. Parameters simulated in this program include mutation rate, selection intensity, mortality rate, and migration rate. Furthermore, analysis is conducted on the allele frequencies over a number of generations.

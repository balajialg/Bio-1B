    "One of the first problems to work through when looking at a data set is to determine whether or not the trends in the data are significant or purely due to random chance. In this particular lab we are trying to determine whether or not the difference between the ecological healths of the two branches of the creek are significant or if it is due to chance. To do this we begin by forming a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis to test. A null hypothesis claims that there is no statistical difference between two distributions and that any difference is due to experimental error or chance. An alternative hypothesis essentially counters the null hypothesis and claims that the difference in distribution is significant. An example of a null and alternative hypothesis for this lab would be: \n",

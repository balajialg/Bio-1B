hi All, Happy New Year!  
I am happy to meet with you when you next get together.  
I met with the Bio1B staff and they are on board.  I described what we are doing and showed them the Strawberry Creek Notebook.  

After I met with them, I edited the SC notebook--and uploaded an edited version with a new name.  Changes include:
  Edited some of the wording to match the lab.
  Added an excel file, similar to what they will upload.
  Extended the analyses at the end to include all the biological measures.
  Deleted the bootstrapping, which we thought was too much to include in the lab.
  
Also, I created a new notebook based on yours, to use in the lecture to introduce Jupyter Notebooks before the lab.
This notebook includes:
  Comparison of Darwin finches before and after a drought.
  All the same analyses they will do in the lab.

I think both of these are coming along nicely.

I am very excited about using the Notebooks in class.

all the best for 2020,
George
